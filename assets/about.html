      <h2>Our Commitment to Your Well-being</h2>
      <p>
        The LIU-Brooklyn Psychological Services Center is dedicated to providing 
        free, confidential counseling to all eligible LIU-Brooklyn students. We 
        understand that navigating college life can present a variety of challenges, 
        and we're here to help you through them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our commitment extends to fostering a diverse and inclusive environment 
        where every student feels valued and respected. We offer a space of safety, 
        free from judgment. We have no session limits or requirements to disclose 
        your identity. You remain eligible for services as long as you are a student 
        at LIU.
