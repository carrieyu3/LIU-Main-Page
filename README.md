Students at Long Island University Brooklyn campus are facing lacking mental health resources. Despite high levels of stress and academic pressure, there is a lack of support from the campus's mental health facilities. This project aims to close that gap by improving the way students access mental health services.

Objectives And Goals:
- Increase Awareness: Enhance visibility of LIU Brooklynâ€™s mental health resources.
- Improve Navigation: Redesign the website for clearer, more intuitive access to mental health services.
- Streamline Access: Implement an online scheduling system for counseling appointments.
- Engagement: Use materials such as implementing a QR code on a flyer so students are able to access LIU brooklyn mental health services.
